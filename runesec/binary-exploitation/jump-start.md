**Name**: Jump Start  
**Points**: 130  
**Instructions**: Sometimes developers forget to call because they're in a rush to compile their [binaries](https://challenges.runesec.com/static/da0defaeee428ba0873c5ceeb8f70636/jumpstart).  
**Hint**: Bunnyhopping is more stringent than just-a-string  

## Exploration
- `$ strings jumpstart`

That looks like our flag, but scrambled.  

- We open the file with radare2. There are some interesting print statements.  
```
;-- main:
...
0x080485ad 6838870408 push str.Where_s_the_flag___:D ; str.Where_s_the_flag___:D ; "Where's the flag?? :D" @ 0x8048738                                            
...
```
```
;-- polling:
...
0x08048548 6880860408 push str.Congrats__you_found_the_flag_ ; str.Congrats__you_found_the_flag_ ; "Congrats, you found the flag!" @ 0x8048680   
...                 
```

- The string in `main` is just taunting us. The real thing is in `polling`. But, as the challenge instructions suggest, there's no call to `polling`.

## Exploitation
We can use `gdb` to manipulate the flow of the program. Put a breakpoint at main, then *jump* to `polling`.

```
$ gdb jumpstart
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
(gdb) jump polling
Congrats, you found the flag!
