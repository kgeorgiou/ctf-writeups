**Name**: Hide And Seek  
**Points**: 80  
**Instructions**: When there is nothing left to hide, there is nothing left to seek: hidenseek.jpg  
**Hint**: Let's play a game!  

## Exploration

- We open the image. No signs of a flag.

- Maybe we can open this image in photoshop and start playing with the colors (invert, contrast, etc,) maybe there's something's to be discovered.

## Exploitation

Our photoshop were in vain.  

However, we've discovered this tool called [steghide](http://steghide.sourceforge.net/). Seems like the go-to steganography encode/decoder.

There's an online running steghide at https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html. We upload the image and this tool kindly gives us the flag.
