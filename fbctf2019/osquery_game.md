osquery> E0604 02:23:12.839308 31978 challenge.cpp:457] The sheep was not next to his friend the pig. He saw you and ran away scared.
E0604 02:23:12.839395 31978 challenge.cpp:458] You failed a quest and cannot win the game. Please retry.
```

### Observations

1. As the first quest states, the 🐑 sees us and runs away 😢. We need to be quick. We'll need to automate this with a script.
2. The farm game extension gets triggered every time we query the `farm` table and makes the game progress by 1 day. This is important since we only have 5 days to complete our (3) quests.
3. Since osquery supports `SELECT` statements only, we need to figure out how to issue a game command. `SELECT * FROM farm WHERE action={action_name} src={src} and dst={dst};` does the trick (`src` and `dst` can be in the form of `0xFF`, `0x10` or `255`, `16`, etc.

#### Quest Steps Breakdown

1. Observe farm arrangement (randomly arranged on each session): `.all farm`
2. Move the sheep next to pig: `SELECT * FROM farm WHERE action='move' src=0x33 AND dst=0x8D;`
3. Pick up the water plail that the sheep was sitting on: `SELECT * FROM farm WHERE action='pickup' AND src=0x33;`
4. Plant the seeds at one of the plowed plots: `SELECT * FROM farm WHERE action='plant' AND dst=0x1B;`
5. Water the seeds we've planted: `SELECT * FROM farm WHERE action='water' AND dst=0x1B;`
6. Pick up our grown plants: `SELECT * FROM farm WHERE action='pickup' AND src=0x1B;`

We are only 6 steps away from the flag! But wait... That translates to 6 days in the game, we are only allowed 5!

We try this anyway and we get the bad news on day 6:

> E0604 02:55:41.121774 2939 challenge.cpp:506] The farming season is over.

We failed.

1. Is it possible to combine 2 steps in one query and save a day?  
   Nope. Trying to nest more than one `SELECT` statements in a single query:

   > E0604 03:02:22.856065 3858 challenge.cpp:516] You can only perform 1 action a day.

2. Is it possible to move the 🐑 next to the 🐷 without taking a peek at the farm first?
   Nope. This took some time to put together, so it deserves a mention:

```
SELECT farm, action, src, dst, fmt FROM
(SELECT farm, action, src, dst, REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(SUBSTR(farm, 37, 500), 'F', ''), 'E', ''), 'D', ''), 'C', ''), 'B', ''), 'A', ''), '9', ''), '8', ''), '7', ''), '6', ''), '5', ''), '4', ''), '3', ''), '2', ''), '1', ''), '0', ''), CHAR(10), '') as fmt FROM farm LIMIT 1)
WHERE action='move' and src=INSTR(fmt, '🐑') and dst=(INSTR(fmt, '🐷')-1);
```

Magnificent. Still a big fat *nope* though. `src` and `dst` need to be actual numbers.

### Key Insight

Remember when I said each query on the farm table makes the game progress by 1 day?

> W0604 03:00:35.531996 3600 challenge.cpp:512] Good morning! It is day 4/256 🌞

Well, an accidental infinite loop in our script revealed that if we issue more than 256 queries on the farm table, the season starts over from day 1 again!

That's infinite extra days for us to perform our last action to pickup our 🍒 and complete the game!

One last thing we need to be aware of though, as the 4th quest states:

> Weeds grow the first day of each season. Be careful, seeds and small plants will be overtaken.

So we'll have to plant our seeds in the next season to avoid the following dreaded message:

> W0604 03:46:06.483491 10980 challenge.cpp:501] Some plants or seedlings were overtaken by weeds.
